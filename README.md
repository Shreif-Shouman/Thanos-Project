# Thanos-Project
Thanos is a Python script to randomly delete  half of the population from the Universe folder.
Please before run it, make sure that you have done a backup of your universe.
How it works? Samply, run the script and it will asks you to enter the folder path you want to delete files from.Then will give you message that your order is done, Unless the folder has only one file or empty. Finally will re-ask you if you want to perform a second order or not.
This script is designed in a safety way, That's why asking you to enter the folder path first then perform the process and not working automatically alone to avoid any clicking mistakes.
