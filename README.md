## :boom: Thanos

**:warning: Caution:** "Thanos" is a Python script designed to randomly remove half of the population from the "Universe" folder. 

Before running the script, please ensure that you have created a backup of your universe.

### How it Works

Here's how "Thanos" operates:

1. Execute the script, and it will prompt you to enter the path of the folder from which you want to delete files.

2. After you provide the folder path, it will confirm that your request has been executed unless the folder contains only one file or is empty.

3. The script will also ask if you wish to execute a second request.

### Safety First

This script has been designed with safety in mind. It requires you to input the folder path and manually initiate the process to prevent accidental actions. It does not operate automatically to avoid any unintended deletions.

**:bulb: Tip:** Please exercise caution when using this script and ensure you have a backup of your files before running it.
